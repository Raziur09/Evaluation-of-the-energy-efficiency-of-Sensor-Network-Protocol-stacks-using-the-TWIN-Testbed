# Evaluation-of-the-energy-efficiency-of-Sensor-Network-Protocol-stacks-using-the-TWIN-Testbed

It is a student project at University Bremen under the department of Sustainable Communication Networks. The project is still ongoing in evaluating the energy efficiency of the used Sensor Nodes

## Task description

A very simple network protocol RIME is used upon implementing the "Collect" applicaiton along with energest module to transfer data and calculate energy efficeinfy for the sensor nodes implemented using the TWIN test-bed. The energest mudules are used to calculate the amount of energy required for a sensor to operate using different mac protocols like ContikiMAC, CXMAC and Sicslowmac. 

Later the sensor data are analyzed using Python script to visualize the behaviour of the sensor nodes.
