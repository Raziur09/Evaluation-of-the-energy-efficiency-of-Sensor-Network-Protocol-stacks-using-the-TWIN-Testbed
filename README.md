# Evaluation-of-the-energy-efficiency-of-Sensor-Network-Protocol-stacks-using-the-TWIN-Testbed

It is a student project at University Bremen under the department of Sustainable Communication Networks. The project is still ongoing in evaluating the energy efficiency of the used Sensor Nodes

## Sensor node

Zolertia Z1

## Task description

A very simple network protocol RIME is used upon implementing the "Collect" applicaiton along with energest module to transfer data and calculate energy efficeinfy for the sensor nodes
